simply run `carthage bootstrap` to install the dependencies.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. I only take pull requests with passing tests.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted,

* Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution
